##LUNEXA THE CHATBOT ##
Lunexa is a lightweight, interactive chatbot developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to simulate natural human conversation through a web interface. Built without heavy frameworks, Lunexa demonstrates how front-end technologies can be used creatively to deliver responsive and engaging chatbot experiences. The chatbot features a clean and modern UI, handles basic user input, and provides intelligent replies through a scripted or rule-based logic system. Lunexa can be easily integrated into websites for customer support, FAQs, or educational interactions. Its modular structure allows for future enhancements, such as API integration, natural language processing, or machine learning features.
