##ðŸŒŸ LUNEXA: The Chatbot
Lunexa is a lightweight and interactive chatbot developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aimed at simulating natural human conversation within a web interface. Built entirely without heavy frameworks, Lunexa showcases how core front-end technologies can be leveraged to create responsive, engaging, and user-friendly chatbot experiences.

Featuring a clean and modern UI, Lunexa handles basic user input and responds intelligently using scripted or rule-based logic. It can be seamlessly integrated into websites for purposes such as customer support, frequently asked questions (FAQs), or educational interactions. Its modular code structure also allows for easy upgrades â€” including API integration, natural language processing (NLP), or even machine learning enhancements in the future.
